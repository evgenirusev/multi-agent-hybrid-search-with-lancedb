    You need to determine the appropriate agent to handle the following query:
    
    "{query}"
    
    Your job is to analyze the query and decide if it should be handled by:
    1. The Employment Expert - for questions about employment contracts, salaries, stock options, vesting queries.
    2. The Compliance Specialist - for questions about regulatory compliance, data protection, legal requirements, or when a user question has something like 'Can the platform help me...' or 'How does the platform...'.
    3. The Equity Management Expert - for questions about equity management, shareholders, directors, cap tables, voting rights, seed rounds, funding, share classes or generally anything else equity-related.
      - please note that if a query contains "Can the platform help me..." or "How does the platform..." then it should be handled by the Compliance Specialist, despite mentioning equity.
